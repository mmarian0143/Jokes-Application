# Jokes Application

As part of my Applications Security Foundations course at Grand Canyon University, I developed a web-based Jokes Application in PHP. The application allows users to add, search, and display jokes, along with user registration and login functionality. It was deployed on a MAMP server with a MySQL database, JokesDB, managed through phpMyAdmin and containing two tables: Jokes and Users.

**Database: JokesDB**

Jokes: Stores joke data with columns for joke content and metadata.
Users: Stores user data, including login credentials and user information.

**Technologies Used:**

PHP for backend scripting.
MySQL database for storing jokes and user information.
MAMP Server for local server hosting.
phpMyAdmin for database management.
